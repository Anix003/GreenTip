    "crop_type": "Eggplant",
    "overall_health": 6,
    "justification": "Considering the brown spots on the eggplant, indicating potential disease or pest damage, and the moderate soil moisture, the overall health is rated as 6/10.  The weather conditions are generally favorable, but the disease needs to be addressed."

      "1. Identify and treat the disease affecting the eggplant. This may involve fungicide application or other disease management strategies.",
      "2. Improve soil moisture by adjusting irrigation practices.",
      "3. Consider supplementing phosphorus and potassium to enhance fruit development and overall plant health.",
